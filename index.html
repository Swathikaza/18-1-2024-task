<p>over 1.4 million requests for service (NCI, 2003). The impetus underlying the creation of
the CIS was the assumption that all cancer patients should receive the best care. To
accomplish that end it was felt that free and easy access of consumers to credible
information was critical (Morra, Van Nevel et al., 1993).</p>
        <h1> KM Roles in the CIS</h1>
        <hr style="border: 2px solid black;">
        
<p>To accomplish its KM work the CIS has developed several specialized, functional roles
in its 14 Regional Offices (ROs). The major roles in each of the RO’s include, Project
Directors (PD), Telephone Service Managers (TSM), and Partnership Program Managers
(PPM) and subordinate Partnership Coordinators. These roles differ both in their
position requirements and in their organizational status level, with PDs the day-to-day
managers for the regional CIS offices (Morra et al., 1993).</p>
<p>TSMs are in charge of managing the Information Specialists (IS) and the referral
resources. The IS within the CIS, who serve as knowledge brokers, have a unique cluster
of skills: though the CIS is not a help/counseling “hotline,” callers are often very anxious;
information specialists must be able to communicate highly technical information clearly
to callers who come from all demographic groups and who differ considerably in their
levels of knowledge (Davis & Fleisher, 1998; Morra, 1998). Performance standards for
telephone calls are set nationally and are monitored by an extensive formal evaluation
effort unique for telephone services (Kessler, Fintor, Muha, Wun, Annett, & Mazan,1993;
Morra, 1998). IS are clearly constrained to be information providers within strict
protocols, to not interfere with existing medical relationships, to refrain from counseling,
and to provide callers with quality assurances of information they provide (e.g., “this is
consensus scientific information”) (NCI, 1996).</p>
<p>The CIS Partnership Program is designed to reach out to people, especially the medically
underserved and minority communities, who do not traditionally seek health information,
providing equal access to cancer information from a trusted source (http://cis.nci.nih.gov/
about/orgprof.html). PPMs are responsible for disseminating health messages through
networking with other organizations such as local American Cancer Societies, state
health departments, and so on. In doing this they serve a strategic multiplier function for
the CIS, increasing the health literacy of clients.</p>
<h2>Designing for KM</h2>
        <hr style="border: 2px solid black">
    <p>The traditional CIS telephone service is literally the tip of the iceberg of a very
sophisticated KM system that has considerable strategic advantages because of its
commitment to translating the highest quality, consensus based scientific information
to the public. Enhanced information seeking possibilities for the public are created by
new technologies, representing an information architecture, in three areas: data storage,
data transport, and data transformation (Cash, Eccles, Nohria, & Nolan, 1994). While we
will discuss these components separately, increasingly it is their blending and integration that is creating exciting new opportunities for information seeking (Case et al., 2004).</p>
    <p>Networks, like the Internet, usually combine enhanced telecommunication capabilities
with software that allows linkage and exchange of information between users (one of
which is often a database). In the health arena these benefits and possibilities are
captured under the heading of health informatics. Consumer health information is
perhaps the fastest growing area of this specialty (MacDougall & Brittain, 1994).</p>
    <p>Telecommunication systems such as fiber optic cables and satellite systems provide the
hardware that links individuals and provides enhanced access to systems. Telecommunication systems maintain communication channels (e.g., e-mail) through which information is accessed and reported. They can specifically enhance the information seeking of
patients by creating new channels for sending and receiving information (e.g., Live Aid
feature on CIS’s Web site), helping them in filtering information, reducing their dependence on others, leveraging their times to concentrate on the most important tasks, and
enhancing their ability for dealing with complexity. One example of enhanced data
transport lies in the benefits of telemedicine: increased access to information, increased
consistency in medical decision making, matching diagnostic and management options
to patient needs, increased quality of care, more interpretable outcomes, increased
efficiency, increased efficacy, decreased costs, and a more uniform structure for healthcare
(Turner, 2003).</p>
    <p>Essentially databases provide a means for storing, organizing, and retrieving information. Modern conceptions of storage have broadened this function considerably to
include verification and quality control of information entering a storage system. Doctors
have historically mistrusted medical information systems because they may not capture
the subtlety and nuance that only their long experience and training can bring to a
situation (Shuman, 1988). They also do not provide much assistance to health professionals in areas where there is low consensus knowledge (Brittain, 1985). Unfortunately,
a number of scientific controversies in well established areas have emerged in recent
years that even peer review may not successfully address.</p>
    <p>To their credit, the authoritativeness of the information they provide has always been
a paramount concern for government databases. In the cancer area the NCI’s Physician
Data Query (PDQ) has been paying systematic attention to these issues for two decades
(Hibbard, Martin, & Thurin, 1995). PDQ was originally designed to address the knowledge gap between primary care physicians and specialists. In a 1989 survey of primary
care practitioners two-thirds felt that the volume of the medical literature was unmanageable and 78 percent reported that they had difficulty screening out irrelevant information
from it (Hibbard et al., 1995). “This knowledge gap is responsible for the prolonged use
of outmoded forms of cancer treatment resulting in unnecessarily high rates of cancer
morbidity and mortality” (Kreps, Hibbard, & DeVita, 1988, pp. 362).</p>
    <p>Fundamental to PDQ is the recognition that the rapid dissemination of health information
is critical to successful treatment, since at the time it was created in the early 1980’s
approximately 85 percent of cancer patients were treated by primary care doctors (Kreps
et al., 1988). In its early days one-third of the PDQ usage came from the CIS (Kreps et al.,
1988), reflecting a high level of usage by the lay public that has continued to this day.</p>
    <p>PDQ seeks to provide a current peer-reviewed synthesis of the state-of-the-art clinical
information related to cancer (Hibbard et al., 1995). PDQ contains several components.
        Cancer information summaries in both health professional and patient versions on adulttreatment, pediatric treatment, supportive care, screening and prevention, genetics, and
supportive care. A registry of clinical trials and directories of physicians, professionals
who provide genetic services, and organizations that provide cancer care is also
available.</p>
    <p>A critical issue facing all databases is how old, irrelevant information is culled from any
storage system. A not so apparent problem of public databases, like many of those
available on the Internet, is the potential lack of timeliness of the information. The cancer
information file of PDQ is reviewed and updated monthly by six Editorial Boards of cancer
experts in different areas. These Editorial Boards have clear guidelines on levels of
evidence for information to be considered for the database. CIS IS receive extensive
training on cancer-related issues and the use of PDQ (Davis & Fleisher, 1998; Fleisher,
Woodworth, Morra, Baum, Darrow, Davis, Slevin-Perocchia, Stengle, & Ward, 1998).</p>
    <p>More generally, HHS through the NIH’s National Library of Medicine and the Office of
Disease Prevention and Health Promotion’s National Health Information Center, have
devoted considerable resources and given thought to building a national information
infrastructure in the U.S. The integration of data storage and transport with sophisticated
software offers unique opportunities for solutions that transcend the limits of individual
information processing, especially that of novices. Combining databases and telecommunications with software creates telematics that allows for the possibility of increasingly sophisticated searches for information and analysis/interpretation of it once it is
compiled. The CIS IS, acting as a knowledge broker, serves a critical function in
translating information into knowledge for increasingly literate health consumers.</p>

        <h3>Consortia and Clinical Knowledge Management</h3>
         <hr style="border: 2px solid black">
    <p>The future of KM in clinical settings is likely to be a turbulent one. It is clear, however,
that those in clinical settings will be asked to do more with less. Thus, increasingly
organizations will be looking for partners to provide services they cannot provide—in
this role the CIS can be a key strategic partner for clinical practice allowing those in clinical
settings to concentrate on their central, unique missions. Government information
providers can act as central repositories for information services that would be provided
before, during, and after client interactions with clinical organizations. They can do this
in the ad hoc, random basis currently characteristic of a client’s information environment
(pattern a in Figure 2), or they can form explicit partnerships (paths b, c, and d) with clinical
practice in consortia.</p>
    <p>Consortia are particularly interesting settings in which to examine these issues because
of the voluntary nature of relationships within them, which often creates a situation that
is a mix of system/altruism and market/self-interest. A consortium can be defined simply
as a collection of entities (e.g., companies, occupational specialties, community members) brought together by their interest in working collaboratively to accomplishsomething of mutual value that is beyond the resources of any one member (Fleisher et
al., 1998; Johnson, 2004).</p>
    <p>Organizations often find that they are either strapped for resources or are pursuing
projects of such magnitude that they must pool their resources to pursue innovations
(Hakansson & Sharma, 1996); developing cooperative relationships with other entities
promotes the possibility of resource sharing and greater efficiencies, especially in
community (Dearing, 2003) and governmental settings (Dorsey, 2003; Parrott & Steiner,
2003). Fundamentally, consortiums are formed so that their members can accomplish
more than they could do on their own. Given the interest in new organizational forms,
heightened competition, fractured communities, and declining resources available to any
one group, this topic has captured the attention of researchers in a wide range of
disciplines (Hakansson & Sharma, 1996; Johnson, 2004).</p>
    <p>The focus of these consortiums should be on providing consistent health-related
messages and information (resulting from relationships described by b, c, and d in Figure
2) that through their repetition from multiple trustworthy institutions increases the
probabilities that clients will comply with the best medical advice. The CIS’s existing PPM
provides the critical foundations for the development of such consortia (Thomsen &
Maat, 1998). Indeed, increasing health literacy by encouraging autonomous information
seekers should be a goal of our healthcare system (Parrott, 2003). While it is well known
that individuals often consult a variety of others before presenting themselves in clinical
settings (Johnson, 1997), outside of HMO and organizational contexts, there have been
few systematic attempts to shape the nature of these prior consultations.</p>
    <P>If these prior information searches happen in a relatively uncontrolled, random, parallel
manner (pattern a), expectations (e.g., treatment options, diagnosis, drug regimens) may
be established that will be unfulfilled in the clinical encounter. The emergence of the
Internet as an omnibus source for information has apparently changed the nature of
opinion leadership; both more authoritative (e.g., medical journals) and more interpersonal (e.g., cancer support groups) sources are readily available and accessible online
(Case et al., 2004). This is a part of a broader trend that Shapiro and Shapiro (1999) refer
to as “disintermediation”—the capability of the Internet to allow the general public to
bypass experts in their quest for information, products and services.</P>

    <p>Contemporary views of health communication are more likely to stress a dialogic view
of interaction, with both parties initiating and attending to messages in turn (paths b, c,
and d). Health professionals’ most important role in these more contemporary perspectives is as stimulus or cue to action, defining the agenda of the most important issues
that an audience needs to face (path d). For those clients who have had no prior contact
with a clinical organization, the CIS can provide referral services (path c in Figure 2) for
clients predisposed to act. About 20 percent of callers to Midwest Regional Office of the
CIS last year asked for referrals to health professionals, treatment facilities, and/or
community services (http://www.karmonos.org/cis/telephone.html). Clinical entities
should be familiar with this referral process and the kinds of information provided to
insure a smooth encounter with referred clients.</p>
    <p>Proactive prior referral and/or exposure to an information source such as the CIS can ease
the burden on clinicians by transmitting basic information to clients that then does not
have to be repeated in an office visit (path c). Increasingly the focus of health
communication campaigns is on getting people to seek more information on health topics
(Parrott, 2003; Salmon & Atkin, 2003). Creating rich information fields through such
practices as ‘self-serving’ to information from data bases, for example, should make for
a more informed consumer, who is likely to consume less time of health professionals
“being brought up to speed” on the basics of his/her disease and its treatment. As we
have seen, this enhanced level of health literacy can result in various improved outcomes
for clients.</p>
    <p>Similarly, as part of a visit clinicians can encourage individuals to use services like the
CIS to secure a second, complementary opinion (path d). These services can provide
crucial background, support, and assurance to clients from neutral third party. For clients
the CIS IS act as a knowledge broker synthesizing and translating information, thus
relieving clinical settings of this task. The CIS can perform many of the same functions
that call centers and customer relations staff can provide for information technology
services. Similarly, it has taken on the increasingly critical role of referral to clinical trials
for new and/or experimental treatments (http://cancer.gov/cancerinfo/pdq/
cancerdatabase), something that should be done in concert with clinical practice (path
b).</p>
    <p>While the CIS, and similar government services, have often been viewed as competitors
or interlopers into clinical practice, its access to NCI’s research infrastructure, the
development of authoritative guidelines (PDQ), and its role in translating this information
to the public, demonstrate it can be a key contributor to a more effective healthcare
delivery system (NCI, 2003). In the past, through clients, it has directly acted to
disseminate information to improve practice. The ultimate outcome of effective KM is the
rapid adoption or creation of appropriate innovations that can be successfully implemented within a particular organization’s context. In the case of the CIS there was an even
broader mandate, a latent purpose to insure the rapid diffusion of state-of-the-art medical
care to the public. By explicitly recognizing, managing, and supporting this role, clinical
entities can more effectively manage their limited resources to insure that consonant
information is provided to clients that is more likely to result in positive healthcare
outcomes. While often services like the CIS have been viewed as a competitor, it may be
better to view it as a complementary/supportive service, especially for government
driven healthcare systems.</p>
